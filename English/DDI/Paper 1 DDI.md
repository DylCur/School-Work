In the extract, Adichie presents Ugwu's impression of the city as sceptical but overwhelmingly positive.

He shows that Ugwu impression is overwhelmingly positive as he states that "He would never be able to describe". The usage of the adverb and hyperbole "never" shows how incredibly overwhelming the city is as the denotation of never is that it is impossible for the event - in this case describing the city - to happen. This connotes with overwhelming positivity as it links to the fact that this exceeded his initial expectations - which were sceptical but cautiously optimistic; this is because when you cannot describe something, you want the other person to experience it first-hand and cannot sum up the experience in words. This links to positivity as he believes that the experience is that incredibly, he believes that his sister should experience it for herself and words would not do it justice. The writer does this to emphasise how incredible the city is as he could describe it, as it is described immediately after this quote, but but believes that the experience is the only thing that can do it justice. This makes the reader intrigued as we are being told about this impossible good city and we ourselves would like to learn more about this awe-inspiring city.

The writer shows that his impression before he arrived to the city was sceptical as he says he was "choked by expectation". The verb "chocked" denotes being unable to breathe due to a blockage in your throat; it has negative connotations of death and struggle which link with this metaphor to show how Ugwu was struggling to grasp how the city could meet his incredibly high expectations. This shows that Ugwu had impossibly high expectations - and as we see later, those expectations are exceeded - that he believes that the city will not live up to. The writer does this in conjunction with the hyperbole mentioned prior in order to emphasise how incredible the city is; the fact that he set it these impossibly high expectations and it not only met them, but exceeded them shows how incredible the city is and, in turn, how amazing he thought the city was.  This makes the reader exited about the city as they are being told about how amazing it is from Ugwu and they want to find out more about why and how its so amazing.

The text begins with an asyndetic list which includes some unusual description of the "Master". The usage of this list is significant as it allows the writer to list lots of information in short time frame. With this list being at the very beginning of the novel,
