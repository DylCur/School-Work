# We Do

At the beginning of the extract, we are introduced to the settings and characters. Mosse uses in media res to immediately establish a dangerous setting and tone. The descriptions foreshadow the potential reoccurrences of theses dangers throughout the text because pathetic fallacy in "the dark and gloomy weather". The reader feels suspense and anxious for the character who is in this situation. 

In the middle of the extract, the dangerous setting is emphasised through the usage of irony when the main character is told "Good Luck" when leaving the carriage only to be immediately greeted on the outside by a "clap of thunder". This is ironic as she has just been wished good luck and is immediately having bad look - the opposite of good look. This is significant in emphasising the danger as it foreshadows that there is more to come and the thunder is only a warning. The readers feelings of suspense will be heightened here as the story develops and becomes more dangerous and nerve-wracking .
