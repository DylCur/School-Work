## Answer

I believe a sense of  panic is successfully created with the intent to build tension but I don't believe we fear for her and her dad as we cannot see and definite danger. Panic is built through the usage of personification when "her voice was carried away by the wind". This personification creates a sense of panic as it suggests that her "voice [being] carried away" is intentional which would suggest that they are not alone. What's more, her voice getting "carried away" builds on the already tense atmosphere by isolating each character. This juxtaposition between them being isolated but not alone foreshadows that something is going to happen to them; this in conjunction with them being isolated and, therefore, vulnerable builds panic in the reader. The writer does this in order to build tension through the panic as the reader becomes hopeful that the outcome will be good but realistic that its unlikely.

Panic is also build with a cyclical short paragraph in "[t]he man fell again, got up again". This is cyclical as to fall you must get up and vice versa; this is significant as prior to this the tension and panic has been building and we are expecting, via prior foreshadowing and irony, something dangerous to happen to the father. With this prior initialised tension and the man falling over cyclically, we begin to panic for the father as he is similar to the man. This also shows that they are not alone, but distanced with creates a panic through a juxtaposition between isolation and them not actually being alone. The cyclicality of it also suggests that this could happen to them which makes the reader feel the panic that is creates as they begin to worry for the safety of not only Connie and his father, but this new isolated man who is cyclically falling. The writer does this in order to build tension and worry the reader though the panic of 3 people safety.
