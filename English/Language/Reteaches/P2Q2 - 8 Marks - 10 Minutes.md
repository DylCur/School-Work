Write about the methods the characters use to get to sleep

In Source A "therapeutic electromagnetic mattress" suggests that the writer is reliant on modern technology to the point where they are buying products that don't even work, simply because it's technology. This links to the impact modern technology has on our sleep, mobile phones and computer screens keep us awake at night; certain beds can help people sleep. This is a contrast to the archaic methods used in Source B, she counts her "Multiplication Table". This suggests that she is attempting to naturally tire herself, she is not using any modern, desperate technology; she is using obvious methods that will tire her out so she can sleep easier.
