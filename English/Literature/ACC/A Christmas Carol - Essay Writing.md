In the extract, Dickens presents his belief that we need to be charitable and to share positive Christmas spirit through Fred's speech towards scrooge at the end. In this speech, Fred says, "Many... good... by which I have not profited". The verb profited is significant as during the Victorian era, the divide between the working class and upper class was vast as the upper-class did everything for profit. With the contemporary reader being the upper class, - as they were literate - this is Dickens's attempt to communicate with the upper class - more specifically the government - and tell them that they don't need to do everything for profit; he is telling the upper class that they need to be for charitable to the poor. This links in with Christmas spirit as Dickens presents Christmas as an optimal time to be charitable  and a time where Christmas spirit should fuel your charitable deeds. Dickens does this because he wrote an allegory, Dickens wrote 'A Christmas Carol' with the intent to communicate to the government and upper class that they need to change and be more charitable and that Christmas should be less of a time of material things and profit and more of a time full of Christmas spirit, cheer and family. This message is especially relevant today as transnational corporations function with the sole purpose of selling you as much Christmas themed products as possible at Christmas time.

This is similar to at the end of the novel where Scrooge changes into a better man who embraces the spirit of Christmas and charity. Scrooges shows this by paying for Tiny Tim's treatment and saving his life. This is significant as Scrooge is an extended metaphor for the government; because of this, this would suggest that Tiny Tim is an extended metaphor for the working class as he is barely functional but happy. Scrooge (The government) saving Tiny Tim (The working class) shows the government (The contemporary reader) that there is limited time to save the working class - as if Scrooge didn't help Tiny Tim would've died; this shows how important charity is as without it, Tiny Tim - who is still a child - would've died. This also links to Christmas spirit as it shows the importance of the joy and miracles that the Christmas Spirit bring as without it, Scrooge would never have donated to charity and if that didn't happen - as shown by the ghost of Christmas past menacingly - Tiny Tim would've died. Dickens does this to show the importance of charity and how the government need to use both that and their Christmas spirit in order to save the working class.
