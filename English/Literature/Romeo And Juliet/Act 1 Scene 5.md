This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
Come hither, covered with an antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
# Capulet
Why, how now, kinsman, wherefore storm you so?
# Tybalt
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,                               
A villain that is hither come in spite,
To scorn at our solemnity this night.
# Capulet
Young Romeo is it?
# Tybalt
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
# Capulet
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.
He bears him like a portly gentleman,


And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well-governed youth.


I would not for the wealth of all this town
Here in my house do him disparagement.
Therefore be patient, take no note of him.                     
It is my will, the which if thou respect,
