# About Tybalt
- Tybalt is a catalyst
- Tybalt is an instigator
- He causes the triadic events in the play

Towards the beginning of the play, Shakespeare presents Tybalt as a villain as Tybalt says "Fetch me my rapier, boy-" when he hears Romeo's voice. This sentence is imperative which shows that his tone of voice is demanding and aggressive; this presents him as a villain as it shows that he is disrespectful and abusive to his PAGE. The noun "rapier" is a sword; rapiers are quite impractical and flashy which shows that Tybalt has an ego to him as he is so confident in his fighting skills that he can focus more on how he looks when fighting than the practicality of his fighting. This would also suggest that he gets into many fights and has to look appealing to anyone that sees him which links to his violent nature. The denotation of violence is using physical force to cause harm; this connotes with villainy
