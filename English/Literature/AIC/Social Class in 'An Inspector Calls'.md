## Start

Throughout the text, Priestley presents the social class as incredibly important and the future of our society and the upper class as stupid and incapable to emphasise this.

At the start of the play, Mr Birling says that the titanic is "unsinkable". This play was set before 1912 and was told after 1912 (The year in which the titanic sank); because of this, the audience already know that the titanic sinks but Mr Birling doesn't. This presents Mr Birling as foolish as he believes that he knows it all and presents his point as if it is fact, despite him begin wrong. With this book being a way for Priestley to express his views, this could show what Priestley thinks of the upper class; they are stupid and obnoxious. This could suggest that Priestley believes that the social class is important as the upper-class are incapable and unintelligent. Priestley does this in order to show how the audience - who would've been mostly communist soviets - that socialism is important and that the upper class should be rid of.

In the middle of the text

At the end of the play the inspector talks about the importance of the social class when he suggests that the upper class are ignorant and obnoxious and "They will be taught in fire and blood and anguish". With the inspector being Priestley's mouthpiece, this is Priestley communicating his opinion; that he thinks that the upper class has to change and they have to change fast. "Fire" and "blood" and "aguish" all connote hell and death which could suggest that the upper class do not change something bad is going to happen to them. Priestley is educating the upper class because they are stubborn and non-changing in their ways; this could be Priestley showing us how educated and open minded the working class are. Priestley does this in order to show the audience how important the social class as the upper class are stubborn and will not adapt to the future.
