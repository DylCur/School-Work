## Compare how the two writers compare their different thoughts and feelings about the Antarctic

7) Because it presents two comparable ideas and embeds a quote in order to prove they know what they are talking about.

In Source A, Fogle and his friend are panicked by the danger of their situation in the cold, causing them pain. He wonders what he has got himself regretfully. In B, however, they even take time to photograph the view beside a comfortable housing to stay happily.

Fogle creates a sense of danger in source by personifying the weather making it seem like a physical enemy when he says "Every breath stung as the freezing air burned my through". This suggests that the weather is penetrating the writer therefore it is a personal attack on the Fogle and because it is going after him it becomes his enemy. Fogle chooses personification to create this effect because it makes the weather feel alive and emphasises its power. As the Antarctic itself is a very mysterious place, the idea of it having its own consciousness is petrifying. The juxtaposition of "freezing" and "burn" creates an uncomfortable tone; Fogle feels he is unable to overcome this weather because of its otherworldly nature. This gives the audience 

However in source B he is more comfortable even going as far as "gathering it in with camera and cinematograph". "Gathering it in" is a colloquial phrase that you would use casually; this juxtaposes with the arctic as the Antarctic is typically violent - as seen in Source B - however here, he is calm and comfortable. A "cinematograph" is a camera that can record video; for this to be viable, the weather would have to be stable and relatively hot - so the components of the camera do not freeze, resulting in the camera camera braking - which connotes comfortability - especially in the arctic - and suggests that in the arctic, he is comfortable enough to set up his camera and cinematograph. What's more, cameras and the like in 1911 would take an incredibly long time to set up which means he would have to be comfortable for up to hours. Scott could be doing this as a way to flex, he is bragging about going to the Antarctic and acting like it isn't a big deal; this would be a strong flex as in 1911 few - if any - people had been to antarctica.
