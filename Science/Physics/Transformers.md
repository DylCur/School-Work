# The national grid

Power Station: $25KV$ → Step-up transformer → Power Lines: $132KV$ → Step down transformer → Factories → Homes: $230V$

## 64:
- A high voltage means a low current to transmit the same power. This reduces the energy lost as heat due to resistance in the wires.

  $V_p \times I_p = V_s \times I_s$
1)  
  $12 \times 0.1 = 48$
  $\frac{1.2}{48} = x$
  $x = 0.025$
  
  2) $40 \times \frac{3}{230} = 0.52A$
3) $\frac{500 \times 400}{400} = 500$
4) $4.95A$
5) $221A$
