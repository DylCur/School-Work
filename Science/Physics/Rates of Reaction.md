1) The higher the surface are, the greater the rate of reaction
2) Because there is more area for the particles to hit
3) The thermal energy is converted to kinetic energy and, therefore, they move faster
4) Because there will be more particles that can hit the particles at once
5) As the time increases, the amount of product increases at a constant rate until it begins to decrease.
6) Because the concentration is decreasing as the amount of products increase.

# Questions
1) 
	- As the concentration increases, the rate of reaction increases
	- As the temperature increases, the rate of reaction increases
	- As the time to cross increases increases, the rate of reaction decreases

1231  / 411= 4 .12314
1478 / 518 = 2.889
120 = 1231 / 10.31
1231 / 10.31 = 120
