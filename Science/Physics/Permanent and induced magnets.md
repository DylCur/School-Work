># Steps
>1) Put Compass at one end of the magnet
>2) Dot where he needle points
>3) Move the compass so the back end of the needle aligns with the dit
>4) Repat
>5) Draw line to join dots


# Notes
1) A bar magnet is a permanent magnet
2) An induced magnet is temporary
3) The plotting compas needles are permanant magnets
4) The iron filings are induced magnets:
	1) When you removed the magnets, they didn't stick together
5) Induced magnets are only magnetic when they're in a magnetic field


# Induced Magnets
- An induced magnet is temporary
- It only remains magnetic while its in a magnetic field
- Each paperclip acts like another magnet with a north and south pole
	- ![[Pasted image 20240123124734.png]]
- The poles need to alternate:
	- N, S, N, S
	- S, N, S, N


>[!SUMMARY] Earth's Magnetic field
>
A compass contains a needle, which is a small magnet pivoted in the middle. The north pole of the compass needle will be attracted to the south pole of a nearby magnet. The south pole of the compass needle will be repelled by the south pole of a nearby magnet.
>
>The earth's core is magnetic, so the Earth has a magnetic field. The poles are near the north pole and the south pole. The north magnetic pole is called north because the north end of a compass needle is attracted to it.

# Questions:
5) The student could get the NORTH side of the bar magnet and rub it against a paper clip. They could then place the paper clip on the south pole and they will attract. You can then repeat this with more paper clips in order to build a chain of paper clips. This proves that there is temporarily induced magnetism as, eventually, the clips will fall off when they lose their charge or the bar magnet is taken away.
