$Power(w) = \frac{Energy}{Time}$

#### 1 watt = 1 Joule per second

# Equations
$$\begin{aligned}
Power = current \times potential \ difference \ (P = IV) \\
Power = \frac{energy}{time} \\
Power = current^2 \times resistance \\
Energy = current \times potential \ difference \times time
\end{aligned}$$

1) Calculate the power of a mobile phone that transfers 25J of energy in 5 Seconds

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{25}{5} = 5V
\end{aligned}
$$
