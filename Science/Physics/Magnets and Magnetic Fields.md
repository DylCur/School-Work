# Magnetic Materials Are:
## Iron, steel (Iron and carbon), nickel and cobalt 

# Magnetic Fields:

- A magnetic field is the space around a magnet where a magnetic material experiences a force.
- Magnetism is a non contact force - the magnets do not need to be touching for the force.
- Field lines go from north to south poles
- The closer the lines are together - the stronger the magnetic field

# Practical: Observing a magnetic field
1) Put a magnet in the bag
2) Put the bag on a flat surface and put a piece of paper on it
3) Pour Iron Fillings on the paper 
4) Get the bag from under the paper and **Without removing the magnet from the bag** use the magnet to pick up the iron filings
5) Once you are done dispose of the iron filing or put the iron filings back

# Plotting method

1) Put the plotting compass against the magnet
2) Put a dot at where the arrow is facing
3) Move the back to the dot
4) Repeat 2) and 3) until you are done
5) Draw a line between each of the points
