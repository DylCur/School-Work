1) It provides the crops with nutrients
2) Something that is not living that effects an ecosystem
3) predators, prey, plants
4) Organism that produces its own source of nutrients

- Advantage: Wont catch anything it wasn't intended to, e.g. dolphins, biological control
- Disadvantage: Faeces polluting the ecosystem, parasites spread more easily, 

**Introduction of non indigenous species**
- Introduction of lants or animals into ecosystems where they are not naturally found.
- Grey Squirrel coming to the UK


**Eutrophication:**
1) The farmer spreads fertilizer on the field
2) When it rains, rain washes excess fertilizer into a nearby body of water (Pond, river or lake).
3) The fertilizer gives lots of nutrients to the algae which can then grow grow rapidly. This is called an algal bloom
4) The algae grow and cover the entire surface of the water
5) Sunlight is blocked by the algae
6) Under water plants die because they can't do photosynthesis
7) The dead plants under the water begin to decompose
8) The bacterial reproduce rapidly and use up all of the oxygen to respire
9) All of the other organisms in the water will die
