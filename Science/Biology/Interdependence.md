# Definition

**Interdependence -** Organisms relying on other organisms for resources. A change in the population of one organism has a knock-on effect on **all others** in the ecosystem - even if they are not directly relevant. 

- The population of Elks, Bison and rabbits would increate because there would be no grey wolves to kill them
- Because of this, the population of Grasses would decrease as there would be more organisms to eat them
- Because of this, most of the Elks, Bison and Rabbits would die because they would have less food
- Because of this, most of the grey wolves and brown bears would die.
- The population of brown bears would increase as they would have more organisms as they wouldn't have to compete with the Grey Wolves
