# Sea Water â†’ Drinking Water

Desalination is the process of removing the alt from sea water to make it drinkable.

A scientific way to say drinking water is potable water.

To do this water processing lants will boil the water to make it evaporate then condense the water vapour back into liquid water.

1) Desalination is the process of removing the salt from sea water to make it drinkable
2) An advantage is there is near limitless water in the ocean and a disadvantage is that it requires salt water so if you are not near an ocean it is inefficient.
3) Because we have enough fresh water from lakes and rivers and rain and don't need to use salt water.
