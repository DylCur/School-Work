#### Endothermic

Endothermic reactions take in energy, the substance gets cold, the temperature decreases.

#### Exothermic

Exothermic reactions take in energy, the substance gets cold, the temperature decreases.


## Physical Change:
- No new substance is made
- Reversable
- Usually a change of state

## Chemical Change:
- New substance made
- Atoms are rearranged

| Substances | Initial Temperature | Final Temperature | $\Delta$Temperature |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Citric Acid and sodium hydrogen carbonate | 21 | 19.21 | 2.9 |
| Zinc metal and copper sulfate solution | 22 | 48 | 25.4 |
| Ammonium chloride and barium hydroxide  | 22.7 | -27.2 | -49.9 |

## Experimental Procedures 
- Use a polystyrene cup - it is an insulator to reduce energy losses and making the temperature range more accurate
- Measuring cylinder accurately measures volume of liquid
- Measure the mass of dry substances and powders
- Always stir, even temperature
