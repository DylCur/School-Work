# Reaction Profiles

A reaction profile shows $\Delta$Energy in a chemical reaction.
# **Endothermic and Exothermic diagrams**

### Endothermic
- The products have more energy than reactants so the extra energy comes from the surroundings. As energy is taken in the substance gets colder.

### Exothermic
- The reactants have more energy than the product. The extra energy is dissipated to the surroundings as thermal energy. The substance gets hotter.

# Questions

**A chemical reaction happens when atoms collide with enough energy. The minimum energy needed for a successful collision between the reactants is the activation energy.**

$\Delta Y$ At the peak $=$ Activation energy on an **Endothermic Reaction**

![[Pasted image 20240202104220.png|700]]

Distance between the starting line and the peak is the activation energy
$$A_e = P_y - R_y$$
Activation energy $=$ Y of the **peak** $-$ Y of the **reactants** 

# Questions

1) The $f_e > i_e$ (Final Energy $>$ Initial energy)

## Exam Practice

1) Measuring Cylinder

# Bonding and $\Delta$Energy's

To **BREAK** bond in reactants you need to take in energy , so the bond **BREAKING** is endothermic.

To **MAKE** bonds, you release energy so bond **MAKING** is exothermic.

An exothermic reaction = more energy is given out **MAKING** bonds than needed to break bonds.

An endothermic reaction $=$ Less energy is given out **MAKING** bonds than is needed to **BREAK** bonds.

24) Because it needs the activation energy
25) a
26) It cools down
27) It heats up 
28) Because it only gets enough activation energy to make instead of breaking
29) Waste energy is dissipated to the surroundings as thermal energy
30) $?$
31) Breaking is exothermic which uses less energy than making which is endothermic
