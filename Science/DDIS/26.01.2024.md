# Physics

1) Because as the current increases, the number of electrons increase and the electron collisions transfer the energy into thermal energy.
2i) 
   - potential difference = current x resistance
   - $0.2 \times 15 = 3$
2ii)
- $0.2^2 \times (15 + 20) = 1.4$
3i) 
- Not directly proportional 
- As the voltage increases, the current increases
3ii) 

|  | Voltage in V | Current in mA |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| point P | 1 | 20 |
| point Q | 3.5 | 43 |

3iii) $51 \times 1,000 = 51,000$
	$\frac{4.5}{51,000} = 0.0000\dot882352941176470\dot5$
3iv) 
- Because they are proportional but not directly

4) 
   - resistor
   - filament lamp
   - diode

5ai) Done on sheet
5aii) Light Dependant Resistor
5bi) $1700\Omega$ 
5bii) $\frac{170}{0.0018} = 9,444.\dot4$
5biii) 
- It decreases
- Because it is a light dependant resistor
6i) Done on sheet
6ii) Done on sheet
6iii)
- There is a point where the magnetic field is strongest 
- Everything is attracted to north
7i)
- Begin at a low current
- Place the nail in place
- Measure the poistion of the bottom of the nail
- Once it is turned on, measure the position of the bottom of the nail
- Calculate the total distance with new distance - initial distance
- Increase the current and repeat this
- You will be able to see if increasing the current increases / decreases / doesnt change the distance.
7ii) E = 1/2 K x $X^2$
- $E = \frac{1}{2}144 \times 24$
- $E = 1800$

8) Done on sheet

9)
- Get the magnet and slowly rub the paper clips on the magnet
- Put the paper clip at the bottom of the magnet
- You can then repeat and put the next paper clips on the preceding paper clip as they are induced magnets


# BIOLOGY

1) Use the same apparatus and method but replace the maggots with something that doesn't respire such as concrete
2)
- As the speed increases, the rate of respiration increases
- There is still respiration whilst stationary
- Humans need more respiration while being more active
3i) B
3ii) In order to prevent STI's

4i) 
- From day 1 - 14 the levels decrease
- From days 15 - 17 the levels increase quickly
- From days 18 - 23 the levels further increase
- From days 24 - 28 the levels decrease

4ii) Because it is releasing an egg

4iii) They are not pregnant as their progesterone levels begin to decrease towards the end of their cycle

5)
- The digestive system
- The body converts glucose to something else
- The body produces insulin in order to convert the glucose to glycogen 
- If you don't have enough glucose, the body gets tired in order to communicate that you need to consume glucose
- Your body can urinate glucose if you have too much
