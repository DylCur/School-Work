Notes:
- **Ovulation**
	- Around day 14
	- Most eggs are underdeveloped follicles
	- Once the egg is released the remainder of the follicles turns into the corpus luteum
	- The corpus luteum release progesterone
	- Endometrium = Lining of the uterus
	- FSH stimulates the growth of a follicles
	- LH releases eggs from the follicles
		- F - FSH → 
		- O - Oestrogen → 
		- L - LH → 
		- P - Progesterone ←←← 
	- **ART**
		- Assisted reproductive technology
		- **Clomifene**
			- Take tablets that contain FSH
			- Take tablets that contain LH
			- First Treatment
			- Taking hormone tables that cause ovulation
		- **IVF**
			- In Vitro (In Glass) Fertilization
			- Injections of FSH and LH
			- Father needs sperm sample 
			- Inject the sperm cells into the egg
			- Doesn't always work
			- Often results in multiple births
- **Adrenaline**
	- Released from adrenal gland
	- Triggers fight or flight response
	- Blood glucose level increase
	- Converts glycogen to glucose
	- Muscles can do more respiration
	- Can do more aerobic respiration
	- Blood vessels into muscles increase in diameter (Dilating)
	- Vessels into organs decrease in diameter (Constricting)
	- Epi-Pens contain adrenaline
- **Thyroxine**
	- Metabolism refers to a group of chemical reactions involved in processing food, removing waste and giving the body energy
	- **Thyroid**
		- Butterfly shaped
		- In neck
		- **Negative Feedback Loop**
			- Hypothalamus (TRH) → 
			- Pituitary Gland (TSH) → 
			- Thyroid Gland (Thyronine) → 
			- Target organs ← ← ← 
			- If thyroxine is too low, the hypothalamus releases more TRH and vice versa


# Questions

1) It remains thick and progesterone levels remain high
2) Clomifene Therapy:
	The tablets contain FSH. After that you take tables with LH. You these cause ovulation. Released in the pertuity gland. Results in high progesterone levels.
IVF
	Injections of FSH and LH. Needs a fathers sperm cell. Injects the sperm cells into the eggs
3) 
4) i) Their levels of oestrogen and progesterone get lower and this causes lower levels of LH
4) ii) 
4) iii) Contains FSH 
4) iv) A

1) i) A
1) ii) 
2) She does not have diabetes because her glucose is in the normal range. She has a hyperthyroid - TSH and thyroxine levels are higher; her metabolism it too high.
3) Hypothalamus (TRH) → 
	- Pituitary Gland (TSH) → 
	- Thyroid Gland (Thyronine) → 
	- Target organs ← ← ← 
	- If thyroxine is too low, the hypothalamus releases more TRH and vice versa
4) Allows for more aerobic respiration. Increased blood flow. Increase Heart rate. Glucose from glycogen conversion.
5) i)
5) ii) Causes the liver to convert glycogen to glucose which increases blood glucose concentration.
