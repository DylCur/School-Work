Notes:
- **Ovulation**
	- Around day 14
	- Most eggs are underdeveloped follicles
	- Once the egg is released the remainder of the follicles turns into the corpus luteum
	- The corpus luteum release progesterone
	- Endometrium = Lining of the uterus
	- FSH stimulates the growth of a follicles
	- LH releases eggs from the follicles
		- F - FSH → 
		- O - Oestrogen → 
		- L - LH → 
		- P - Progesterone ←←← 
	- **ART**
		- Assisted reproductive technology
		- **Clomifene**
			- Take tablets that contain FSH
			- Take tablets that contain LH
			- First Treatment
			- Taking hormone tables that cause ovulation
		- **IVF**
			- In Vitro (In Glass) Fertilization
			- Injections of FSH and LH
			- Father needs sperm sample 
			- Inject the sperm cells into the egg
			- Doesn't always work
			- Often results in multiple births
- **Adrenaline**
	- Released from adrenal gland
	- Triggers fight or flight response
	- Blood glucose level increase
	- Converts glycogen to glucose
	- Muscles can do more respiration
	- Can do more aerobic respiration
	- Blood vessels into muscles increase in diameter (Dilating)
	- Vessels into organs decrease in diameter (Constricting)
	- Epi-Pens contain adrenaline
- **Thyroxine**
	- Metabolism refers to a group of chemical reactions involved in processing food, removing waste and giving the body energy
	- **Thyroid**
		- Butterfly shaped
		- In neck
		- **Negative Feedback Loop**
			- Hypothalamus (TRH) → 
			- Pituitary Gland (TSH) → 
			- Thyroid Gland (Thyronine) → 
			- Target organs ← ← ← 
			- If thyroxine is too low, the hypothalamus releases more TRH and vice versa


# Questions

1) It remains thick and progesterone levels remain high
2) Clomifene Therapy:
	The tablets contain FSH. After that you take tables with LH. You these cause ovulation. Released in the pertuity gland. Results in high progesterone levels.
IVF
	Injections of FSH and LH. Needs a fathers sperm cell. Injects the sperm cells into the eggs
3) 
4) i) Their levels of oestrogen and progesterone get lower and this causes lower levels of LH
4) ii) 
4) iii) Contains FSH 
4) iv) A

1) i) A
1) ii) 
2) She does not have diabetes because her glucose is in the normal range. She has a hyperthyroid - TSH and thyroxine levels are higher; her metabolism it too high.
3) Hypothalamus (TRH) → 
	- Pituitary Gland (TSH) → 
	- Thyroid Gland (Thyronine) → 
	- Target organs ← ← ← 
	- If thyroxine is too low, the hypothalamus releases more TRH and vice versa
4) Allows for more aerobic respiration. Increased blood flow. Increase Heart rate. Glucose from glycogen conversion.
5) i)
5) ii) Causes the liver to convert glycogen to glucose which increases blood glucose concentration.


# Physics

**Notes:**
- Same direction → Stronger
- Opposite direction → Weaker
- Stronger Field → Lines closer together
- Difference Above and below → Force
- Force of the wire is out of the page
- Always draw magnetic filed north to south
- Increasing size of force:
	1. Stronger Magnet / Magnetic Field
	2. More current
	3. More wire in magnetic field
- F = BIL || $Force = Magnetic \ flux \ density \times current \times length$ 
- Magnetic flux density is measured in tesla (Field Strength)
- **Questions**
	- 7. The rod will go upwards because the force is out of the page 
	4. $2(4)(2) \equiv (8)(2) = 16N$
	5. $30(2)(2) \equiv (60)(2) = 120N$
	6. $0.5N = B \times (0.5 \times 0.5) \equiv 0.5N = 0.25B \equiv B = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2$
	3. b. i. High current needs a low resistance so you use a thick wire. This prevents overheating.
	3. b. ii. When the current flows in the wire it generates a magnetic field. There is a stronger field below the wire compared to above so it experiences a force.
	3. b. iii. By using weaker magnets and by moving the magnets further apart.
	4. b. i. 
	4. b. ii. Right
	5. ii) Turn the magnets around and Reverse the current direction
	5. iii. Weaker | Decrease in field so less strength
- As you move the wire (Or Magnet), it cuts the magnetic field limes and this induces a potential difference (pd)
- To increase the size of the induced voltage you:
	- Increase the strength
	- Increase the number of turns
	- Move the magnet in a and out of the magnet faster
- To change the direction:
	- Swap the poles of the magnet around
	- Move in the opposite direction 
- If there is no movement, there is no inducted potential difference and no current will flow
5. When you move the wire where it cuts the magnetic field and incudes a potential difference. 
6. The voltage is induced because moving the wire cuts the magnetic field lines and induces a potential difference 
7. The strength of the magnet and increasing the number of coils
8. The primary coil is supplied with an alternating current. This produces a changing magnetic field. The magnetic filed passes through the iron core. The changing magnetic filed is inside the secondary coil. This then causes an ac to flow.
9. dc is unidirectional. Any current does not produce a changing magnetic field. Need a changing magnetic field to include a voltage
10. Increase the potential difference because we need to supply the power with less losses / more efficient.
11. Thermal Energy 
12. Iron / Cobolt
13. $P_p = P_s$  $V_PI_P = V_SI_S$
	$275000(I_p) = 230 \times 95 \equiv I_P = 0.08$
14. $1.2(2.5)(0.06) = 0.18N$ 
15. Your extend your thumb and index finger and curve your middle finger at $90 \degree$. The thumb is force 
16. Equal in size and opposite in directions 
17. 0.045 = 0.72 x I x 30x10$^{-3}$ = 21

# Chemistry

**Notes:**
- Oxidation and reduction both happen
- Oxidation can mean adding oxygen to something (E.G. Rusting) or loss of Electrons
- Reduction can mean the loss of something (E.G. Oxygen) or a gain of Electrons
	- Oxidation
	- Is
	- Loss (of electrons)
	- Reduction
	- Is
	- Gain (of electrons)
- Spectator Ion is an Ion that is unchanged throughout a reaction
- They can ask you to identify a spectator ion
- **Half Equations**:
	- Shows oxidation and reduction in a reaction
	- An electron is $e^-$
	- You cannot say $e^-_2$ it has to be $2e^-$
	- $Zn(s) + CuSO_4(aq) → ZnSO_4(aq) + Cu(s)$ 
		1. $SO_4^{2-}$ 
		2. $Zn^{2+}, Cu^{2+}$
		3. Zn
		4. Cu
---
		  6.   $Zn → Zn^{2+} + 2e^-$
***
		1. $Cl^-$
		2. $Ti^{4+}, Mg^{2+}$ 
		3. Mg because it is an atom becoming an ion
		4. Ti

		6. $Mg → Mg^{2+} + 2e^-$

- **Concentration**
	- As it gets more acidic, the number of $H^-$ increases and vice versa
	- More Basic = Higher pH
	1. $\times 10$
	- A strong acid fully dissociates into ions (Spits from)
	- A weak acid does not **fully** dissociates
	1. $\times 10$
	2. $0.05g$ 
	3. The Ph increased by 1
	4. Because it fully dissociates into ions
	5. Ph = 1
	6.
